          <h4>Brief History</h4>
          I have become increasingly interested in how technology can be used to both improve our ability to communicate and manage and enhance our physical world.  The majority of my software development expertise had initially been in C and Java, building projects such as a user-level unix-like operating system and a distributed web crawler and search engine in CIS380 and CIS555 respectively at U Penn.  Having sustained a season-ending shoulder injury that required both surgery and extensive rehabilitation with strict mobility restrictions, I decided to utilize the doctor ordered down time to greatly diversify my computer language skillset to include HTML, CSS and Javascript.  This process has also provided an opportunity for me to apply some of what I studied as part of my Fine Arts minor.  Building upon the sophistication of the web app I had created for Project VariChill as a marketing tool, I was able to secure paid assignments to create, refine and manage commercial websites for small businesses.  
          </br>
          </br>Two illustrative examples of my assignments are Conejo Valley Basketball Club (CVBC) and Battery Streak, Inc.  CVBC is an example of a relatively unsophisticated client who, although they have very strong views regarding messaging toward their target customers, presented a substantial challenge because they had to be educated as to both the variety and limitations of the latest web-based communication and transaction technologies.  Given the relative tech-ignorance of a few key decision makers, I gave presentations explaining how and why the mobile environment has become so critical and how the structure of their messaging must be crafted to be just as rich, dynamic and effective as in a computer environment.  They ultimately realized a rapidly growing percentage of their existing and prospective client base will interact with their web tools exclusively via mobile devices and understood the need to adopt a more sophisticated approach.  (See <a href="http://www.cvbbc.com">Conejo Valley Basketball Club</a>)
          </br>
          </br>Battery Streak, Inc. is a polar opposite challenge that is nevertheless a lesson in tech-based communication.  Battery Streak is a power storage and recharging technology start-up in its infancy.  While the company principals are sophisticated and respected technology executives, their intended communication targets include individuals who might be relatively unsophisticated with respect to the internal technology.  They include potential capital sources, commercial bankers, service providers, potential strategic partners and possible retail customers.  The initial website needed to provide a communications bridge for those that need to quickly grasp the benefits and advantages of an emerging technology before the company is willing to delve into the complexity of proprietary intellectual properties.  The website needed to provide clear and approachable language with interesting and engaging imagery as a broad introduction to what is projected to be a revolutionary product.
