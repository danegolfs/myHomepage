        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="aboutText text-justify">
          My name is Dane Walton and I am currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft, working on the C SDK team for Azure IoT.
          </br>
          </br>
          I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in December of 2017. I was one of only about 20 Engineering students admitted each year to undertake the interdisciplinary "Computer Engineering" major, an extremely rigorous program that prepares its graduates for technology opportunities in both hardware and software development. The unique curriculum combines in-depth study in the otherwise singular majors of Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Math. Project development assignments required fully integrated design, development and physical execution of all hardware and software systems of original, marketable concepts. (see "<a href="varichill.html">Project VariChill"</a>)
          </br>
          </br>
          I was pleasantly surprised to also find an artistic outlet at U Penn, leading me to pursue a minor in Fine Arts. I chose to concentrate my study in the area of photography and have developed what will be a life-long passion for artistic vision and expression. (See "<a href="photo.html">Photography</a>")
          </br>
          </br>
          I was fortunate to receive collegiate offers to extend what had been an elite-level, youth sports experience. The opportunity to receive an education from one of the world's finest institutions and to compete at the highest level in Division 1 Athletics was a dream come true for me. I've now traveled to England and Scotland after qualifying to compete in the European Junior Championships. I've had the pleasure of traveling throughout the United States with my U Penn teammates as their Team Captain. And together, we won an Ivy League Championship and competed in the NCAA D1 Regional Championships. I was privileged to serve on the U Penn Student Athlete Advisory Committee, representing the interests of student athletes with the University Administration. As I was unable to compete due to injury, the University asked me to serve as the Assistant Men's Golf Coach last year. With family issues challenging the Head Coach, I then had to lead the team as their Head Coach when we traveled to compete in last year's Ivy League Championships. The game of golf has blessed me with immeasurable life experiences and helped me develop invaluable life skills.
